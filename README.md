# My Resume

I have two resumes to suit different career paths! I am a multifaceted engineer
with a focus on full stack web software and firmware engineering. In my free
time I dabble in electrical engineering as well!

Please make sure you get the correct resume version! Or take both :)

This is the [source code](./resume_software.typ) and
[rendered version](./bradley_hutchings_swe_resume.pdf) of my resume software
engineering resume.

This is the [source code](./resume_hardware.typ) and
[rendered version](./bradley_hutchings_emb_resume.pdf) of my embedded systems
engineering resume.

## Copyright and License

**TL;DR:** Don't redistribute the PDF. You can use and modify the source code so
long as you strip out all references to me. See the [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file
for details.

## Notes

I modified some svg files by adding `fill="#0b5394"` to the start of the `path` tag.
