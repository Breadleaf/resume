# My Resume

This is the [source code](./resume.typ) and [rendered version](./resume.pdf) of
my resume.

## How to compile

```bash
make build
```

## Copyright and License

**TL;DR:** Don't redistribute the PDF. You can use and modify the source code so
long as you strip out all references to me. See the [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) file
for details.

## Notes

I modified some svg files by adding `fill="#0b5394"` to the start of the `path` tag.
